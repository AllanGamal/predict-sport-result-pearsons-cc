  <h2>Sports prediction</h2>
  <p>Sharing some of the process of the making of this project </p>

  <h2>Project</h2>
    <p>Making a prediction on a final soccer league table standing based on every playser stats for every game of the first half of the season, using webscraping and a mathematical model based on pearsons correlation coefficient. 
</p>

<h2>Thoughts going into the project</h2>

 <h3>Webscraping player stats</h3>
<p>The library used for to collect every player stats is beautiful soup 4. The site to collect the player stats  <link> www.fbref.com </link>, and I will use every player stats to get the best prediction as possible.
</p>

 <h3>Mathemathical model, Pearson Correlation Coefficient</h3>
<p>I do have some Idea of how the model will look, and I can see many potentional ways to proceed the model, so I have to try to restrict and commit to a certain model. The model will be based on the Pearson Correlation Coefficient. It will check every player stats for every game and compare it to the win/loss and hopfully get a correlation coeffeicient. 
</p>

<h3>Pearson Correlation Coefficient</h3>
<p>It is a measure of linear correlation between two sets of data. It is the ratio between the covariance of two variables and the product of their standard deviations. A value of -1 to 1 will be generated, where -1 is a perfect negative correlation, 0 is no correlation and 1 is a perfect correlation.
